# 42SiliconValleyBoost
Code from the Boost Program at 42SiliconValley. We have to follow the standards imposed by the Norm.

Boost was supposed to give us miniture versions of projects so we could get to bigger projects faster -- but we also had to retype the code from scratch on a blank IDE with no internet access within a time limited test. 

**b_libft:** 100%/100% | all_tests: 10/10 correct functions  (30 minutes to retype - Success)

**b_printf:** 100%/100% (Outstanding Project x 2) | test_spd: 4/4 correct functions | test_lsldiouxc: 6/6 correct functions (30 minutes to retype - Success)

**b_ls:** -- Boost was cancelled --
